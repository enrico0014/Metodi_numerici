# Metodi_numerici
Some of the codes that were put forward in the "Metodi numerici per la fisica" lectures' at Unipa.

# Non linear equations
Three methods are presented here. "bis.c" inplements a basic bisection method, "gen.c" consists of a sequence generator method and "rap.c" show the Newton-Raphson method. All of three are presented in a specific implementation in order to solve a particular. Details of those problems are of no importance, since every routine will hopefully works correctly only by substituting the used equation with the desired one.
